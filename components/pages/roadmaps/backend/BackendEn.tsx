        <h2>1. Learn the Basics of Programming</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Start with the fundamentals of programming. Learn how to work with
          variables, loops, functions, and control flow. Choose a programming
          language like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby to build your foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Learn about Databases</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Learn about databases and how they interact with applications.
          Understand SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
          MongoDB. Learn how to manage data, create tables, and perform queries.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Learn about Web Servers</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Web servers are the backbone of backend development. Learn about how
          to configure web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Express.js to handle
          HTTP requests, serve files, and manage routing.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Understand REST APIs</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Learn how to create and consume RESTful APIs. Understand how to work
          with HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and how to structure
          and manage routes for handling requests.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Authentication and Authorization</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Secure your applications with authentication and authorization
          techniques. Learn how to implement user authentication with tools like
          JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth for safe login processes.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Learn about Web Frameworks</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Master backend frameworks like Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python),
          or Ruby on Rails. These tools help streamline backend development by
          providing built-in features like routing, security, and session
          management.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Learn about Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Backend development requires strong problem-solving skills. Learn
          about data structures (arrays, trees, hash tables) and algorithms to
          handle large amounts of data and optimize performance.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Version Control (Git)</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Git is essential for managing code in backend development. Learn to
          commit changes, branch, merge, and work with repositories like GitHub
          to track changes and collaborate with teams.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Testing (Unit & Integration Tests)</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability of your backend code.
          Learn how to write unit tests using frameworks like Jest or Mocha, and
          perform integration testing to catch bugs and ensure smooth
          interaction between components.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Deployment and Hosting</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Learn how to deploy your backend applications to the cloud or
          on-premise servers. Get hands-on experience with platforms like
          Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for hosting your applications and
          databases.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
          Automate your backend development process with CI/CD tools. Learn how
          to integrate tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate testing,
          building, and deploying your backend applications.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Stay Up-to-date</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 leading-[30px]">
